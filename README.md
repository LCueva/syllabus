## Course Description

Understand how to use computers for experimental control, data acquisition, and data analysis, and understand the principles involved in each. Review and consolidate electronics knowledge. Learn the standard tool LabVIEW.

## Homework/Projects

All assignments are listed within the [Course Outline](#course-outline).

These are usually two-person partnerships. It should be written and submitted as a joint effort. The same grade goes to each.

### Workflow
1. To start, [**fork** the repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) for the current exercise/project ([github.com/uw-phys434-fall15](https://github.com/uw-phys434-fall15))
1. [**Clone**](http://gitref.org/creating/#clone) the repository to your computer.
1. Modify the files and [**commit**](http://gitref.org/basic/#commit) changes to complete your solution. Note that
   if use you the git commit command without the -m"comment", it will open the vi editor. You can type in the comment, then
  \<esc\>:x\<enter\> see http://www.lagmonster.org/docs/vi.html
1. [**Push**](http://gitref.org/remotes/#push)/sync the changes up to GitHub.
1. [Create a **pull request**](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) on the original repository to turn in the assignment. You can continue to push fixes and improvements until the due date.

Feedback will be given in the pull request, so please respond with your thoughts and questions! You are welcome to open the pull request as the work is still in-progress if you are stuck and want to ask a question – just mention `@ukaratay` with the question.

### Requirements

These apply to real life, as well.

* Must apply "good programming style"
    * See [Rules to Wire By](/rulestowireby.md)
    * Optimize for readability
    * Documentation
* Bonus points for:
    * Creativity (as long as requirements are fulfilled)

### Pairing Tips

* The person who's less experienced/comfortable should have more keyboard time
* Switch who's "driving" regularly
* Make sure to save the project and send it to both people

### Grading

* Class Participation (10%)
* Homework (50%)
  * Functionality (25%)
  * Documentation (12.5%)
  * Readability (12.5%)
* Project (40%)

## [Class Project](/finalproject.md)
It can be either individual or with a lab partner. If you collaborate, it should be clear who is responsible for which part. Talk to Durmus and Toby if you need an idea for your project. [Here](/finalproject.md#previous-projects) is a list of old project suggestions. Before starting your project you will prepare a design document. [Here](http://1drv.ms/1tlsS5E) is an example design document. This document is a simplified version of [IEEE-1066](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_description).

Proposal design document is due by 11/5/15 5:00pm. Do not start on your project until your design document gets approval.
Finalized documents are due by 12/11/15 11:59pm, it should be a very detailed version of your first proposal.

There will be project interviews on the week of 12/7/15, we will allocate 30 minutes for each project. You are supposed to explain your project in layman's terms, as well as answer questions about the underlying physics.

## Statements on Plagiarism
### UW

> In computer programming classes, borrowing computer code from another student and presenting it as your own. When original computer code is a requirement for a class, it is a violation of the Universityʹs policy if students submit work they themselves did not create. 

### Instructors

You are encouraged to learn from the work of your peers. This class is structured such that all solutions are public. We won't hunt down people who are simply copying-and-pasting solutions, because without challenging themselves, they are simply wasting their time and money taking this class.
